## Process
1. Analyzed my design in Figma.
2. Started to code all the basic html pages (Home, About, and Contact).
3. Added the bootstrap configurations in all of my pages started from mobile-view to desktop-view.
4. Edit some styles on my CSS file from mobile to desktop.
5. Added accessibility.
6. Entered my html codes in the validator.
7. Entered my css codes in the validator.
8. Added the hover animations for my links and buttons.
9. Summarized my process in README file.

## Challenges
1. When I finished my mobile-view, it looks fine but when extend my browser all of the images, icons, and cards are not aligned with each other.
**Overcome** *I researched how to correct the alignment without affecting the mobile-view and found out that I need to put the sizes (sm, md, lg, and xl) on the target elements.*
2. After I targeted the elements, it was still not aligned.
**Overcome** *I investigated my codes and after checking the codes, I separated the rows based on my design for mobile. So, what I did was remove the separation and connects it to the main element and it worked up to my desktop-view.* 
3. The sizing of an images and icons are hard to configure using bootstrap and also the gaps.
**Overcome** *I edited those on my css file.*
